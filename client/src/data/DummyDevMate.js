Semiconductor manufacturing involves various steps, including cleanroom operations, chemical processes, and energy-intensive activities, all of which contribute to different types of emissions.\nIf you are looking for up-to-date and specific emission figures for a particular semiconductor manufacturing facility, it would be best to refer to the facility's environmental reports, which may include data on air emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental metrics. These reports are often published regularly as part of environmental compliance requirements. \nIt's important to note that the semiconductor industry is aware of the environmental challenges and has been actively working on adopting cleaner technologies and sustainable practices to minimize its environmental footprint. Additionally, regional regulations and the availability of renewable energy sources can significantly influence the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing facilities."
